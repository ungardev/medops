# MedOps — Elite Clinical Consultation Management Platform (v1.0.0)

[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/708B1hdxhO8)

---

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

MedOps is distinct because it addresses a domain not covered in any of the previous CS50W projects. Unlike Project 2 (Commerce) or Project 4 (Network), MedOps is not an e‑commerce site nor a social network. Instead, it is a clinical consultation management system designed to handle healthcare workflows. It manages patients, consultations, and habits, providing institutional auditability and financial tracking. This makes it unique in scope and purpose, solving a real‑world problem in healthcare rather than replicating patterns from prior assignments.

The distinctiveness of MedOps also lies in its institutional rigor. It is not a toy project or a simple CRUD app; it is designed to reflect the workflows of real medical institutions. Features such as audit logs, financial tracking with multi‑currency support, and integration of ICD‑11 data demonstrate that MedOps is solving problems of compliance, reproducibility, and professional deployment. This is far beyond the scope of prior course projects.

The complexity of MedOps is evident in its architecture. On the backend, it uses Django and Django REST Framework with multiple models (Patients, Consultations, Referrals, Prescriptions, Treatments, Payments, Reports) and relationships between them. Endpoints are nested, allowing CRUD operations tied to specific patients. Signals, management commands, and serializers add further depth. On the frontend, it uses React with Vite and TypeScript, ensuring strong typing and modular components. State management and API integration demonstrate advanced use of JavaScript beyond simple DOM manipulation.

Finally, MedOps integrates advanced features such as Chart.js  for visualization, TailwindCSS for responsive design, and audit logs for compliance. It is mobile‑responsive, works across devices, and is deployable with Nginx and Gunicorn on Ubuntu/AWS. These features collectively demonstrate complexity well beyond prior projects. This section alone consists of several paragraphs to justify distinctiveness and complexity, as required by the Capstone specification.

## How to Run

### Development Mode (CS50W Demo)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ungardev/medops.git
   cd medops
   

2. **Backend setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver

3. **Frontend setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/medops
   npm install
   npm run dev

4. **Access the system**
   Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   Frontend UI: http://localhost:5173



This mode is used for CS50W submission and demo video, ensuring evaluators can run the system easily.

### Production Mode (Ubuntu + AWS)

---

### Server Environment
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  
- PostgreSQL 16  
- Nginx + Gunicorn  

---

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
gunicorn medops.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000

# Frontend
cd frontend/medops
npm install
npm run build

## Configure Nginx
- Reverse proxy to Gunicorn backend.  
- Serve frontend build from `/frontend/medops/dist`.  
- Enable HTTPS with institutional certificates.  

---

## Environment Variables
- `.env` files documented for reproducibility.  
- Tokens, database credentials, and AWS keys managed securely.  

---

## Usage Notes
- **Auditability**: All actions generate institutional logs (`logs/audit.log`).  
- **Reproducibility**: Any evaluator can reproduce the environment using documented steps.  
- **Scalability**: Production deployment is ready for AWS EC2 with load balancing.  
```
