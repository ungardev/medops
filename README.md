# MedOps — Elite Clinical Consultation Management Platform (v1.0.0)

MedOps is a **large-scale, audited, and professional web application** designed to manage medical and clinical consultations with precision, security, and institutional rigor.  
Developed as the **Final Project for CS50W (Web Programming with Python and JavaScript)**, MedOps demonstrates the ability to transform complex healthcare workflows into a robust, reliable, and visually sober platform.

This project is not just a technical exercise — it is a **proof of competence and gratitude**.  
Thanks to the knowledge and guidance provided by **CS50 and Harvard University**, MedOps was built as a system that reflects the highest standards of software engineering, combining:

- **Backend robustness** with Django and Django REST Framework.  
- **Frontend clarity** with React, TypeScript, and modern design principles.  
- **Institutional auditability** through secure authentication, real-time notifications, and financial tracking.  
- **Professional deployment** with Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn, and AWS.

MedOps stands as an **elite, top-tier clinical management system**, showing how the skills acquired through CS50 empower developers to build projects of true magnitude and impact.
